How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

******Answers to the questions:******
2.The value returned after you printed the ticket is 0.
3.After inserting too much or too little amount of money into the machine, the printed ticket does no give you a refund. It will automatically set it as if you paid the exact amount.
4.Nothing really changed but the the amount due for the ticket.
5.The outer wrapper of the Students and Labclass might have looked like:
public class Labclass
public int numberOfStudents()
6. It does matter. The class diagram changed to red stripes and you can not compile the class.
